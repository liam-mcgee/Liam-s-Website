  <h2>Scratch Game: SAVE PLANET EARTH </h2>
  <p><a href= "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/882394176">Link to Game</a></p>
  <p>For this project, I took the skills Iâ€™d developed during my introductory Scratch coding course and created a game from scratch (from scratch get it haha). I developed a game in which the user clicks on robots to defeat them and save Earth. A counter in the top left allows the user to track their score as they play. Overall, the project was fun and taught me what it was like to come up with an idea and execute it with no real defined prompt; a challenge that I was able to overcome. </p>

    <h2>Scratch App: Polygon Maker </h2>
    <p><a href= "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/900832903">Link to Application</a></p>
    <p>For this project the class was tasked with creating a scratch application which lets the user create a shape with as many sides as they wish, the shape can also be placed anywhere on the screen and have any radius. Overall the project was successful and it was a good learning experience which taught me how to create these math functions (used for different shapes) in scratch. </p>

    <h2>Custom Fidget Spinner </h2>
    <p>For this project my class was challenged to design a 3-D model of a fidget spinner on the website Tinker-Cad so it could then be cut from wood using our state of the art laser cutter. It was difficult with the design constraints of a minimum width per segment and selective materials. Each group member had an extra challenge such as budgeting or managing the laser printer however my challenge was to design caps for finger holds on the device. I had fun during this project and found it cool how I could use different materials to ultimately come together for a finished product. </p>
